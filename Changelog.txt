v1.3.0 as of 18.08.2024
Content:
- Added 3 negative rules.
- Added 1 background.

Changes:
- Updated mod to Starsector 0.97
- 'Antagonizm':
 - Moved blacklist check up in priority.
 - Added 'Stored Frigate' hullmod from 'Indies Expansion' (or 'Aerial Combat Suite', whatever) to the blacklist.
- Moved 'Thin Insulator' rule to combat layer.
- Temporarily disabled visual range circle of 'Doomslayer', it still works.

v1.2.0 as of 07.10.2023
Content:
- Added 1 golden positive, 1 golden negative, 5 negative and 2 milestone rules.

Changes:
- Updated to Starsector 0.96a-RC10.
- 'The Unyielding':
 - Changes to how rule handles transfer countdown.
 - Removed jitter.
 - Added simple effects and sounds for activation and deactivation. Everything is temporary and will be worked on over the course of time. Maybe.
- 'Dazing Pilotage' duration decreased from 3/5/7/12 to 2/3/5/6. This is to make this negative rule a saner choice. It's still annoying but shouldn't be as fatal as before.
- 'Deathless' now only replenishes half the values to capital-class ships.
- Added hullmod blacklist to 'Antagonism'. Added an entire one hullmod to it that doesn't even go nuts at certain conditions when applied to enemy ships by the rule. :crab: SAFETY OVERRIDES ARE GONE! :crab:
	I'll be filling it up over time if/when people or I myself start encountering crashes or other major problems with various modded hullmods added through this rule.
	Modders can add to that blacklist on their own account I suppose. Unless hullmod does something mythical there shouldn't be a need for that.
	Worst case scenario I will reverse it to a whitelist and add a config to enable current behaviour in the future.
	Observe as I get yelled at for not doing that from beginning in 0.0000014 picoseconds after posting update.

- And perhaps other things that I completely forgot to put here and no longer remember what that was. If I forgot, it wasn't that important, right?

v1.1.2a as of 01.03.2023
Changes:
- 'Antagonism' now can add non-smoddable smods. *Beware of Safety Overrides.*

Bugfixes:
- As a result of said change, fixed 'Antagonism' crash and other potential weird activity with 'Progressive S-Mods' (and similar) mod present.

v1.1.2 as of 01.03.2023
Changes:
- 'The Unyielding' now benefits Arma Armatura (and other mods') strikecraft
- Completely rewrote 'Antagonism':
 - Now works with all factions equally.
 - No longer applies 0 and negative OP hullmods.
 - No longer applies logistic hullmods.
 - Properly removes gained S-Mods from enemy ships that retreated or left alive when player retreats.
 - Now works in simulations.
- Icreased 'Antagonism' S-Mod roll probabilities.
- Decreased 'Criminal Imperium' effect power and increased it's cost to 4.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed 'Wish Upon a Star' crash with Nexerelin Task Force disbanding.

v1.1.1 as of 20.02.2023
Changes:
- Adjusted 'The Unyielding' jitter. Again.
- 'The Unyielding' now benefits flagship's modules as well.

Bugfixes:
- Temporarily stopped 'Antagonism' from working on Blade Breakers to avoid summoning Combat Engine Breakers.
- Hopefully fixed 'Full Throttle' shenanigans.

v1.1.0 as of 16.02.2023
Content:
- Added 6 negative, 1 positive and 1 milestone rules.

Changes:
- Now depends on MagicLib. I don't suppose there are people who don't have it.
- Changed 'The Unyielding' jitter into under jitter and increased it's visibility.
- Changed sound effect and added simple visual effect to 'Deathless' triggering.
- Adjusted 'Fox' description for clarity.

v1.0.1 as of 12.02.2023
Changes:
- 'The Unyielding' no longer counts modules as deployed ships.
- Adjusted 'The Unyielding' description.
- Increased 'Mental Warfare' effect power on all difficulties and decreased it's cost by 1. Since rule cost was changed, something may or may not happen to an
in-progress playthrough with the rule already active.
- 'Criminal Imperium' now works with governed colonies.
- Adjusted mod name in modlist. No ID changes were made so I doubt anything will break.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed 'Mental Warfare' not speeding up PPT drain.
- Fixed 'Deathless' locking broken weapons from repairing.
- Fixed 'Wish Upon a Star' increasing terrain CR effect instead of decreasing (:skull:).
